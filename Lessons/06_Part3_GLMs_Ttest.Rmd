## Objectives
1. Describe t-test under GLM framework

## Set up your session

```{r, message = FALSE}
#install.packages('formatR')
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80), tidy=TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

```

## T-Test

Continuous response, one categorical explanatory variable with two categories (or comparison to a single value if a one-sample test).

### Formulating Hypothesis for µ

Two hypotheses are formed – the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
The null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis combine to cover all possible values for the population mean.
The null hypothesis must have the equality.
The null and alternative hypotheses are always stated in terms of the population mean (mu).

### One-sample t-test
The object of a one sample test is to test the null hypothesis that the mean of the group is equal to a specific value. 

Function t.test()
**x**	a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.
**alternative** a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less". You can specify just the initial letter.
**mu** a number indicating the true value of the mean (or difference in means if you are performing a two sample test).
**formula** a formula of the form lhs ~ rhs where lhs is a numeric variable giving the data values and rhs either 1 for a one-sample or paired test or a factor with two levels giving the corresponding groups. If lhs is of class "Pair" and rhs is 1, a paired test is done.

The one-sample t-test relies on the assumption that the variable is normally distributed in the population. However, the t-test is robust to mild departures from normality when the sample size is small, and when the sample size is large the normality assumption becomes less important.


For example, we might ask ourselves (from the EPA air quality processed dataset): 
Are Ozone levels below the threshold for "good" AQI index (0-50)?

### Import data set

```{r, message = FALSE}
EPAair <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/EPAair_O3_PM25_NC1819_Processed.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
# Set date to date format
EPAair$Date <- as.Date(EPAair$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

```


> Exercise 1: State the hypotheses for testing mean of AQI index.

> Answer: 
H0: mu >= 50
Ha: mu < 50

```{r}
summary(EPAair$Ozone) #mean = 40.88 and median = 40
length(EPAair$Ozone) #8976 observations

O3.onesample <- t.test(EPAair$Ozone, mu = 50, alternative = "less")
O3.onesample

Ozone.plot <- ggplot(EPAair, aes(x = Ozone)) +
  geom_density(fill = "gray") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 50, color = "#238b45", lty = 2, size = 0.9) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))
print(Ozone.plot)

# Format as a GLM
O3.onesample2 <- lm(Ozone ~ 1, EPAair)
O3.onesample2
```

Write a sentence or two about the results of this test. Include both the results of the test and an interpretation that puts the findings in context of the research question.

### Two-sample t-test

The two-sample *t* test is used to test the hypothesis that the mean of two samples is equivalent. Unlike the one-sample tests, a two-sample test requires a second assumption that the variance of the two groups is equivalent. 

For example, we might ask ourselves (from the EPA air quality processed dataset): 
Are Ozone levels different between 2018 and 2019?

```{r}
#First let's look at the data
ggplot(EPAair, aes(x = Ozone, color = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_freqpoly()

#Format as a t-test
#EPAair$Ozone will be our continuous dependent variable
#EPAair$Year will be our categorical variable with two levels (2018 and 2019)
O3.twosample <- t.test(EPAair$Ozone ~ EPAair$Year)
O3.twosample

# Format as a GLM
O3.twosample2 <- lm(EPAair$Ozone ~ EPAair$Year)
summary(O3.twosample2)

```

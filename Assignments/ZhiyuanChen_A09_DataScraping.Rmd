## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics on data scraping. 

## Directions
1. Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A09_DataScraping.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3. Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.


## Set up 
1. Set up your session:

* Check your working directory
* Load the packages `tidyverse`, `rvest`, and any others you end up using.
* Set your ggplot theme

```{r, message = FALSE}
#1
getwd()
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("rvest")
library(rvest)
#install.packages("lubridate")
library(lubridate)
mytheme <- theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top")
theme_set(mytheme)
```

2. We will be scraping data from the NC DEQs Local Water Supply Planning website, specifically the Durham's 2021 Municipal Local Water Supply Plan (LWSP): 
 * Navigate to https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/search.php
 * Scroll down and select the LWSP link next to Durham Municipality. 
 * Note the web address: <https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/report.php?pwsid=03-32-010&year=2021>
 
Indicate this website as the as the URL to be scraped. (In other words, read the contents into an `rvest` webpage object.)

```{r set.the.scraping.website}
#2
webpage <- read_html('https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/report.php?pwsid=03-32-010&year=2021')
webpage
```

3. The data we want to collect are listed below:

* From the "1. System Information" section:
 * Water system name
 * PSWID
 * Ownership
 
* From the "3. Water Supply Sources" section:
 * Maximum Daily Use (MGD) - for each month

In the code chunk below scrape these values, assigning them to four separate variables.

>HINT: The first value should be "Durham", the second "03-32-010", the third "Municipality", and the last should be a vector of 12 numeric values (represented as strings), with the first value being "27.6400".

```{r scrape.the.data}
#3
water.system.name <- webpage %>%
  html_nodes("div+ table tr:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(2)")%>%
  html_text()
water.system.name
pwsid <- webpage %>%
  html_nodes("td tr:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(5)")%>%
  html_text()
pwsid
ownership <- webpage %>%
  html_nodes("div+ table tr:nth-child(2) td:nth-child(4)")%>%
  html_text()
ownership
max.withdrawals.mgd <- webpage %>%
  html_nodes("th~ td+ td") %>%
  html_text()
max.withdrawals.mgd = as.numeric(max.withdrawals.mgd)
max.withdrawals.mgd
```


4. Convert your scraped data into a dataframe. This dataframe should have a column for each of the 4 variables scraped and a row for the month corresponding to the withdrawal data. Also add a Date column that includes your month and year in data format. (Feel free to add a Year column too, if you wish.)

>TIP: Use `rep()` to repeat a value when creating a dataframe.

>NOTE: It's likely you won't be able to scrape the monthly widthrawal data in chronological order. You can overcome this by creating a month column manually assigning values in the order the data are scraped: "Jan", "May", "Sept", "Feb", etc...

5. Create a line plot of the maximum daily withdrawals across the months for 2021

```{r create.a.dataframe.from.scraped.data}
#4
df_withdrawals <- data.frame("Month" = c(1,5,9,2,6,10,3,7,11,4,8,12),
                             "Year" = rep(2021,12),
                             "max.withdrawals.mgd" = as.numeric(max.withdrawals.mgd)) %>% 
  mutate(water.system.name = !!water.system.name,
         pwsid = !!pwsid,
         ownership = !!ownership,
         Date = paste0(Month,"-",1,"-",Year))
df_withdrawals$Date <- as.Date(df_withdrawals$Date,format = "%m-%d-%Y")
#5
ggplot(df_withdrawals,aes(x=Date,y=max.withdrawals.mgd)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group=1)) + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess",se=FALSE, color="blue") +
  labs(title = paste("2021 Water usage data for",water.system.name),
       subtitle = pwsid,
       y="Withdrawal (mgd)",
       x="Date")



```

6. Note that the PWSID and the year appear in the web address for the page we scraped. Construct a function using your code above that can scrape data for any PWSID and year for which the NC DEQ has data. **Be sure to modify the code to reflect the year and site (pwsid) scraped**.

```{r construct.a.scraping.function}
#6.
scrape.it <- function(the_pwsid, the_year){
   webpage <- read_html(paste0('https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP',
                               '/','report.php?pwsid=',the_pwsid, '&year=',the_year))
   water.system.name_tag <- 'div+ table tr:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(2)'
   pwsid_tag <- 'td tr:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(5)'
   ownership_tag <- 'div+ table tr:nth-child(2) td:nth-child(4)'
   max.withdrawals.mgd_tag <- 'th~ td+ td'
   
   water.system.name <- webpage %>%
     html_nodes(water.system.name_tag)%>%
     html_text()
   pwsid <- webpage %>%
     html_nodes(pwsid_tag)%>%
     html_text()
   ownership <- webpage %>%
     html_nodes(ownership_tag)%>%
     html_text()
   max.withdrawals.mgd <- webpage %>%
     html_nodes(max.withdrawals.mgd_tag) %>%
     html_text()
   
   df_withdrawals <- data.frame("Year" = rep(the_year,12),
                                "Month" = c(1,5,9,2,6,10,3,7,11,4,8,12),
                                "max.withdrawals.mgd" = as.numeric(max.withdrawals.mgd)) %>% 
     mutate(water.system.name = !!water.system.name,
         pwsid = !!pwsid,
         ownership = !!ownership,
         Date = my(paste(Month,"-",Year)))

   return(df_withdrawals)
}


```

7. Use the function above to extract and plot max daily withdrawals for Durham (PWSID='03-32-010') for each month in 2015

```{r fetch.and.plot.Durham.2015.data}
#7
Durham.2015_df <- scrape.it('03-32-010',2015)
view(Durham.2015_df)
ggplot(Durham.2015_df,aes(x=Date,y=max.withdrawals.mgd)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group=1)) +
  geom_smooth(method="loess",se=FALSE, color="blue") +
  labs(title = paste("2015 Water usage data for",water.system.name),
       subtitle = '03-32-010',
       y="Withdrawal (mgd)",
       x="Date")
```

8. Use the function above to extract data for Asheville (PWSID = 01-11-010) in 2015. Combine this data with the Durham data collected above and create a plot that compares Asheville's to Durham's water withdrawals.

```{r fetch.and.plot.Asheville.2015.data}
#8
Asheville.2015_df <- scrape.it('01-11-010',2015)
view(Asheville.2015_df)
combined_df <- rbind(Durham.2015_df, Asheville.2015_df)
ggplot(combined_df,aes(x=Date,y=max.withdrawals.mgd,color=water.system.name))+
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = paste("2015 Water usage data for Durham and Asheville"),
       y="Withdrawal (mgd)",
       x="Date")
```


9. Use the code & function you created above to plot Asheville's max daily withdrawal by months for the years 2010 thru 2019.Add a smoothed line to the plot.

>TIP: See Section 3.2 in the "09_Data_Scraping.Rmd" where we apply "map2()" to iteratively run a function over two inputs. Pipe the output of the map2() function to `bindrows()` to combine the dataframes into a single one. 

```{r fetch.and.plot.Asheville.multiyear.data}
#9
the_years= c(2010:2019)
the_df <- cross2('01-11-010', the_years) %>% 
  map(lift(scrape.it)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
ggplot(the_df,aes(x=Date,y=max.withdrawals.mgd)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess",se=FALSE) +
  labs(title = "2010-2019 Water usage data for Asheville",
       y="Withdrawal (mgd)",
       x="Date")

```

>Question: Just by looking at the plot (i.e. not running statistics), does Asheville have a trend in water usage over time?

Answer: Yes, generally, Asheville has a upward trend in water usage over time.
